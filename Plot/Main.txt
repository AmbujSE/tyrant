A city riddled with crime and corruption gets introduced to a vigilante that starts to beat up the criminals and the bad actors the city 
officials are baffled by this development as no matter what they do they cannot catch this person from dolling out some street justice 
it seems the that the vigilante is superhuman with his powers and that is where the agency gets involved.

The agency sends a couple of there agents to deal with this problem before the general public can figure out that magic is a real thing 
and the agents have a suspects as well the tyrant a disgruntled employee in his late twenties a loner who crossed over from the other 
side about ten years ago and has been "Intregrated" to the society.

They harass him as he tries to be evasive as he is rude and elusive to every one being mad over his betrayal in the other world and the 
curcumstances of why is was sent here and still not being able to get over it. Not trying to leave anything to chance the agents take him 
with them to go check out there leads to keep an eye on him as he tries to convince them that he is not the vigilante but all the evidence 
points towards him due to incredible stamina of the vigilante because of the unusual heart that is not quiet human in its making but 
something much more powerful as the tyrant explains that he has no disere to become a hero he just wants to be left alone and live out
the rest of his days in obscrurity. but they don't believe him because he has to alibi for him being alone at the time of the vigilante's 
activities.

But it seems that vigilante knows of these agents as well and was waiting on there arival to make his move to expose them to the world but 
that is the long game he says as he looks upon them walking with the pretender. no matter for him as this is going as part of the plan and 
there is no way to stop what is coming.


The way is up not down.
