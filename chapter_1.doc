I am about to be framed into being a tyrant. thought Henry as he walked through the doors leading 
towards the crossing of the worlds and there was nothing he could do to stop the process form 
taking place either they have they had been bring him to back to his home for this purpose 
nothing else. The rebellion was at full swing and his father the actual king and tyrant who 
acutually commmited all those attrocities has fleid the country following some assasination 
attempts upon his life.
"You are the next in line for the throne you highness." said the emmabsy guy they fetched to 
come get me. I know why they had to do this but if I go back things will go out of control and 
any people will die because of it. I am a ticking time-bomb, and my framers know it somebody is 
doing this on purpose I am sure of it somebody who knows what will happen to me once I go back 
home. At this point I wouldn't put this past my father, he must be behind this
